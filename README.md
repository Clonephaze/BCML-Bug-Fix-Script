# BCML Bug Fix batch script


## About <a name = "about"></a>
This is just a simple script meant to simplify the uninstallment of BCML, deletion of its merged folder, and reinstallment of BCML. I originally wrote it in powershell, then python, then realized it was easier and simpler for the user to make a batch file.

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

Download the batch script by either downloading it from the [releases page](https://github.com/Clonephaze/BCML-Bug-Fix/releases/latest) or by right clicking the Raw button on [this page](https://github.com/Clonephaze/BCML-Bug-Fix-Script/blob/main/BCML%20Bug%20Fix.bat) and selecting "save as". Be sure to save it as a .bat file. Once you have it, execute it. It will handle everything then launch BCML. Be sure to click remerge or press Ctrl+M and launch your game when complete.
If the problem persists, try these steps again! The bug can stick around a handful of times and may need multiple attempts to solve.
